## Project Overview
This is a full-stack ASP.NET MVC website for SVM Studio, a high-end photography and styling studio. The website should reflect an elegant, dreamy, and artistic aesthetic inspired by soft lighting, pastel florals, sheer fabrics, and ethereal visual themes.

- **UI/UX**: Clean, responsive design with smooth animations and parallax effects

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: SQL Server/SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 (custom theme), JavaScript
- **Animations**: AOS (Animate On Scroll) or GSAP

4. **Services**: Elegant service packages with pricing
5. **Booking**: Contact form with database integration
